____

 Directions:

 To make the stock:
  1- Add the oil to the pot and heat on high heat
  2- Add the chicken pieces in batches, and sear for 5-9 minutes on each side until golden all over
  3- Add the spices, and toast for 2-3 minutes
  4- Dice the onions and add to the pot, then saute until softened and pot is deglazed
  5- Add the garlic, and saute for another minute before adding the chicken in again and the salt
  6- Fill the pot with water to cover the chicken and bring to a light boil
  7- Skim the surface from scum, and cover with the lid set ajar, temp to medium and simmer for 40-50 minutes
  8- When done, remove the chicken and sieve the stock to remove any onions and spices

 To make the vegetables:
  1- Chop your cauliflower into medium and large florets
  2- Add oil to a pan on high heat, so it's about 1 cm deep
  3- Add the cauliflower to the hot pan and fry on each side for about 5 minutes until browned all over
  4- Remove and allow to drain on paper towels, salt immediately once removed from the oil
  5- Don't forget to fry some garlic

 To make the rice:
  1- Thoroughly wash your rice then let it drain until most of the excess water has drained off
  2- Add to a bowl with the spices and salt and gently mix to combine
  3- Once evenly mixed, pour in the oil and mix once more until the rice is coated in oil

 To assemble:
  1- Scatter a few tbsp of rice in the bottom of your pot
  2- Slice the tomatoes or potatoes into slices, then line the bottom with them
  3- Add the cooked chicken, skin side down, until you have a single filled layer
  4- Cover the chicken and fill any gaps with a thin layer of rice, then add a layer of cooked cauliflower
  5- Finally add the remaining rice on top and spread it into an even layer

 To cook:
  1- Pour filtered stock into the pot, until it just reaches the level of the rice
  2- Turn the heat to high and cover with a lid. Once it comes to a boil, set a timer for 5 minutes
  3- Once the 5 minutes are up, turn the heat to low (2/10) and keep covered for 20 minutes
  4- Pour 2 Tbsp oil around the edges of the pot, then place a paper towel on the top of the pot and place the lid on again
  5- Let it steam for 10 minutes more on low. When done you can serve it immediately, or follow these instructions for a good flip
  6- Let it rest for 15 minutes off the stove. Then place a plate on top, and flip the pot with the plate. Rest for 10-15 more minutes before revealing so the contents can settle
