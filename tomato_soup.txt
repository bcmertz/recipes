Ingredients (4 servings):
- 5 tomatoes
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1/2 small white onion
- 1 head of garlic
- 1/2 tsp fennel seeds
- 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 1/2 tsp harissa paste
- oven dried tomatoes
- 2 tsps tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp honey
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tbsp bouillon paste
- 1 cup water (or more depending on the thickness you like)
- Splash of heavy cream
- Salt to taste
- Crispy fried onions & basil oil to top (optional)
- ajwain (optional)

Directions:
1) In a stainless steel or cast iron skillet, add tomatoes, bell pepper, onions, and garlic (with a few glugs of EVOO and
   sprinkle of salt) in the oven at 425F for 20 min or until the tomatoes burst and then broiler to get it charred for 5 min or
   so (leave in the garlic in the foil for an extra 15 min at 425F)
2) Throw everything into the blender (might have to wait on the garlic if it’s too hot to touch)
3) Wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel and heat up a bit of EVOO and add fennel seeds and black pepper. Toast for 20
   seconds and then add harissa and tomato paste. You want to cook off the tomato paste for a few min and release it’s natural
   sugars so the color should turn from a bright red to a deep red.
4) Add a splash of soy sauce and honey for some umami and to deglaze, then add the whole paste mixture to the blender.
5) Add some bouillon paste and water (or alternatively veggie stock) and squeeze in the garlic if you haven’t already.
6) Blend on high until smooth, taste and add some more stock/water/salt depending on your preferences and a splash of heavy
   cream if you want and blend again.
7) Optional: if you want any kind of soup to be silky smooth, you can pass it through a sieve but I don’t mind a bit of texture
8) Top with basil or basil oil , and serve with grilled cheese! I just used chopped sundried tomatoes, cheese, and butte
9) serve with mozzarella grilled cheese - make butter oven dried tomatoes paste for yummy spread
