Dyrestek (Norwegian venison recipe)

source: papa's mom

Ingredients:
- 3kg deer meat (6 lb)
- 80g butter
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 0.5L milk
- 0.5L water
- 1-2 dL sourcream
- buttermilk

Directions:
1) clean meat
2) soak meat overnight in sour milk or diluted vinegar or buttermilk
3) dry meat & insert strips of fat (?), maybe just dry meat
4) brown meat a lot
5) add water and milk
6) simmer 2.5 hours
7) pour buttermilk on and simmer 15 minutes

Notes:
- there is much ambiguity in milk / sour milk measurements and usage in this recipe, and it was told quite vaguely to me by papa, so use your best judgment or reference another recipe as well
