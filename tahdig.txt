Chelow (tahdig)

Ingredients (2 servings / cup):
- basmati rice
- salt
- oil
- saffron
- salted butter
- [optional] potato / pita for tahdig
- [optional] yogurt / ghee instead of oil for tahdig

Directions:
1) wash rice until it runs clear
2) soak in very salty water for 2-24 hours
3) boil in excess water in LOTS of salt
4) drain once rice is soft (3-4 minutes after boiling for cold water start, 7-10 minutes for hot water start)
5) rinse off excess salt with cold water
----------
6a) mix a couple Tbsp water, saffron water, and oil enough to cover bottom of pan (5-6 Tbsp)
6b) heat until water/oil is sizzling, then fluff in pyramid of rice
----OR----
6a) mix rice, yogurt, oil, water, saffron for bottom layer (hasn't been working for me üôÅ)
----------
7) poke holes in pyramid with the back of a wooden spoon
8) cook 10 minutes medium/high
9) steam 40-50minutes low heat with damkesh on pot lid and some butter on top
10) cool on damp surface 5 minutes still covered

Serve:
1) set aside some rice and mix with remaining saffron water
2) place rest of rice in serving platter without disturbing tahdig
3) detach tahdig and serve around serving tray perimeter
4) garnish chelow with saffron rice on top

THINGS TO TRY:
- *** mix and heat water and oil and saffron in medium thin layer before adding rice***
- maybe don't need to soak rice in salt water before cooking (I doubt), it is done with soak to firm up the rice for the long cook
